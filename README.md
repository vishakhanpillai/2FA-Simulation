# 2FA-Simulation
## Aim
The aim of the project is to develop a two-factor authentication system in C that enhances security by requiring users to register with their credentials, log in, and verify their identity through a randomly generated one-time password (OTP). This simulates a real-world application of 2FA, demonstrating how additional verification can protect user accounts from unauthorized access. 

## Functionalities

1.	User Registration – Users can register by providing a username and password. These details are stored using array of structures.
2.	Generation of 2FA Codes – The program generates a random 6-digit code, which will be unique in each attempt.
3.	Persistent Storage of Users – Maintain user registration details in a file.
